## FAQ
Q: What is BMI?

A: BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.

Q: How accurate is BMI in assessing health?

A: While BMI is a useful screening tool, it does not directly measure body fat or overall health. It's important to consider other factors such as muscle mass and overall fitness level.
